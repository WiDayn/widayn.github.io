<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student studying at College of Computer Science and Software Engineering(计算机与软件学院),  Hohai University([河海大学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohai_University)).

My major is Computer Science and Technology(计算机科学与技术), with an average course grade of 87.78/100. 

I primarily worked under the guidance of Prof. JunFeng Jiang on medical image processing. I participated in several projects and tasks at the ChangZhou Key Laboratory of Digital Technology on Graphics and Orthopaedic implants([常州市图形图像与骨科植入物数字化技术重点实验室](https://dtgoi.hhu.edu.cn/main.htm)). My work involved 3D/2D registration, object detection, and image segmentation.

I was involved in three College Students’ Innovation Program projects, one of which was at the national level and two at the university level. During my time at the university, I received multiple university-level scholarships.

In terms of competitions, I have won one national-level award, one provincial-level award, and several university-level awards.

# 📝 Projects

- *2024.04(Now Working, Cooperating with NEAU)* Field-Road Classification Based on Pixel Mapping

Still working...

- *2024.04* CT Lumbar Spine Segmentation with nnU-Net

![](/images/ct_lumbar_segmentation_1.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

We developed a CT lumbar spine segmentation approach using nnU-Net, focusing on a level of detail not found in current datasets. By annotating nine datasets to differentiate each part within the vertebrae—unlike existing datasets that segment the vertebral body as a whole—my work supports more accurate surgical planning for procedures such as pedicle screw fixation, leading to safer and more precise interventions.

- *2024.03(Under Review)* Localization of Vertebral Levels on Fluoroscopy via Semi-supervised Abductive Learning

- *2023.12* Tibial Midline Recognition Technology Based on U-Net

![](/images/u-net-architecture.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

![](/images/tibia-segmentation.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

We employed the SAM model for simple annotation of the existing dataset and utilized U-Net for training and prediction. To obtain the tibial midline, we connected the midpoint at the top of the mask with the midpoint of the middle segment. The actual algorithm demonstrated good robustness and recognition performance on the dataset.

- *2023.09* Intraoperative X-Ray Image Vertebrae Symbolic Reasoning Recognition

![](/images/x-ray-logic.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

![](/images/x-ray-logic-2.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

Our method combines visual object detection with first-order logic predicate reasoning, effectively improving the recognition rate of vertebral bodies through logical reasoning. The results obtained are more interpretable compared to those from object detection alone. The logic part can be divided into two sections: facts and inferences. The facts are directly derived from object detection, while inferences are automatically generated by a reasoning engine constructed in the Prolog language. The facts we construct come from the results of object detection, and the conclusions are derived directly from these facts.

- *2023.06* Intelligent Recognition and Retrieval System for Medical Documents

![](/images/yizhigu-1.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

The system is based on the Spring Boot and Vue frameworks, incorporating numerous technologies such as WebSocket, Redis caching, RabbitMQ message queuing, and Elasticsearch distributed searching. The purpose is to facilitate document verification, retrieval, automatic archiving, and functions such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from images, text classification (BERT), and translation (openNMT). I am primarily responsible for the construction of the front-end and back-end, as well as the deployment of the entire project.

- *2023.03* Intelligent River Digital Twin Practice Based on WISE-PaaS Cloud

![](/images/wise-paas.png){:width="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto"}

The project is based on the Advantech WISE-PaaS Industrial IoT Cloud platform and focuses on the study of digital twins for intelligent rivers. It aims to monitor and assess target rivers in real-time, ultimately establishing a platform for real-time monitoring and assessment of intelligent rivers.
